#TO DO:

Input constraints

1. not null for all fields.

2. Both deRegWindow and Early Bird Register Date should not be late than event commence date.

3. To Discuss: Should the website allow staff to select event status when they create event. (then make 'open' as default at the back-end)
  (It makes no sense if a staff creates a 'closed' event)

4. When adding one speaker to a new session, this speaker should have already signed up for EMS. 
  If this speaker has not signed up, the staff could not assign this speaker to a session.
  (so staff should ring the speaker up and ask him/her to sign up before assigning)

5. When a staff fills in the create(add) session form, SPEAKER NAME field and SPEAKER EMAIL field should be checked whether they matched the info stored in guest.csv. 

Guest Sign up Constraints

1. Guests have to fill in all three fields in order to be successfully authenticated.

Login Page:

1. The place holder of username field should be changed to "username or email"

Notification:

1. After successful registration, do we need to display notification message saying 'registration successful'?

2. Notification message after successfully creating course/seminar, deregister??
